# Herb 1.0 - Simbad's Discord Bot in JS
Our community's lovely bot written in Javascript. Apparently it works better than in Python but to be honest, who can tell the difference. If anything, it's more of a learning experience than trying to make a more responsive bot.

# Guidebot Framework
The bot is uses anidiotsguide's guidebot as the framework. It's a wonderfully simple framework that's easy to understand, make changes to, and added upon.

# Contributions
Big thanks to [Bevers222](https://github.com/bevers222) for walking me through this learning process, and thanks to Simbad for being my learning environment.
