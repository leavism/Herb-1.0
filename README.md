# Herb 1.0 - Simbad's Discord Bot in JS
Our community's lovely bot written in Javascript. This was a learning experience after a basic CodeAcademy class on JavaScript. I've remade Herb here: https://github.com/leavism/Herb-Bot-2.0

# Guidebot Framework
The bot is uses anidiotsguide's guidebot as the framework. It's a wonderfully simple framework that's easy to understand, make changes to, and added upon.

# Contributions
Big thanks to [Bevers222](https://github.com/bevers222) for walking me through this learning process, and thanks to Simbad for being my learning environment.
